# Plan for the hackathon: 

## Day 1: Hack 1

**In one session, sequential, split into teams (but same task)**

### hack 1 (A): 13:45 - 14:15
Hands on session on using all features of DOME 4.0, through the web interface, including onboarding of data sets (even if they are synthetic) (SINTEF(BT) and UCL(AH) as backup)

Users will find data that are relevant to them (but does not have to be for the hackathon), the main goal is to learn the end user aspects. Report: is what do we like and what we do not like in DOME 4.0. 
  
### hack 2 (B):
- **IDMT Case: 14:15 - 14:35** Preview what the IDMT data/ontology is about, upload it through the ontology interface of DOME 4.0, then perform searches and visualisations. [CMCL(AB)]
- **Pharma Case UCL(CW) 14:35 - 15:00**
  - ?connector to one of the open MRI databases (UCL/AH,SINTEF/TJ)
  - ?building a basic ontology of the data sets already available at Chris's group. [UCL/OB/LZ]
- **COFFEE BREAK 15:00 - 15:30**
- **Onboarding and Ontology Mapping in Python (UCL/OB) 15:30 - 16:15**
  - API to scan publications (from arxive) and pulling in the data into a DME 4.0 data set and uploading then visualisation, we can then think how to add this as a service into DOME 4.0, so we can relate papers to data sets and vice versa.    
- **Lingyun 16:15 - 16:30**
  - Nasicon battery data case, and digitalising it into the Data set ontology of DOME 4.0 [Lingyun]
- **Adrien 16:30 - 16:45** about demonstrating how he integrated a "secret application " by mixing the DOME 4.0 platform and the containers running locally behind firewalls [Candidate Adrien, Adham to contact]
- **The Chase Case (20 min)** - Noel and Silvia. Tell people what Chase is (chemical data with prices, IDs, IDs connecting with each other). Ideas:
  - upload TTL files?
  - Combine with other data, create a JSON-LD, then upload ttl?

# Day 2: Problem Hack 2 (or Storyboard Development)
Here we will have two options, or strands, potentially 4. 
1. Story board development **11:00 - 12:30**:
   - based on hack 1 and the other sessions, what does DOME 4.0 still needs, what can we do to take it to the next level!
   - can't even connect to Google API!
   - a group discussing monetization avenues for stakeholders/platform, business models and exploitation avenues
   - what other technical aspects can be done, can we use what we developed in a different more useful way? what do we need to do with provenance?

**LUNCH 12:30 - 13:30**

**All in one group**

1. **VIPCOAT-OpenModel-DOME 4.0 Case 13:30 - 14:30** (Casper, Treesa)--> (OTEAPI compatibility and uses)
2. **address one of the use cases in details...need more details, e.g. from CMCL 14:30 - 15:00**
  * CMCL connector provides emission simulation data
  * given the label (e.g. CO or SO2), search Chemeo and/or Pubchem GHS for more data
  * combine them in a Jupyter notebook (a new "app")
3. Documentation building from a user perspective (Willem/Bijan)
